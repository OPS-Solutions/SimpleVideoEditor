1.61% should work, (so 17 threshold)

4.1% messes something up
4.3% safe

10 - 31855 (full length)
17 - 31854 (2192 length)
23 - 31854, 33057 (split in the middle)
26 - 31854 (short)
41 - 31854 (short)
42 - 31854 (short)
43 - 31854,33057,33058

Thresh 17 - min 600, gives full ending length 2192 frames
Thresh 17, min 1500, misses the entire ending (should theoretically be able to use as high as 2192)
